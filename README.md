### Repository Title: 
**Cluster Analysis & Profiling on Business, Entertainment, Education, and Retail Data**

### Description:
This repository contains three diverse case studies applying cluster analysis and profiling techniques across various domains:
1. **Spotify Song Dataset** – Discover hidden patterns in music preferences and song characteristics.
2. **Harvard Course Dataset** – Uncover student segmentation based on course selection and learning behavior.
3. **Starbucks Beverage Dataset** – Analyze beverage preferences and customer segmentation for better marketing strategies.

Each case study involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering using techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN, and detailed cluster profiling to derive actionable insights for business decisions.

### Objective:
The objective of this repository is to demonstrate the application of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically cluster analysis, in extracting meaningful insights from datasets across different industries. By grouping data points into similar clusters, this project aims to showcase how businesses can use data to better understand customer segments, optimize offerings, and enhance personalization strategies in music streaming, education, and retail.
